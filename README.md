## my-muell adapter for ioBroker

Calls API https://mymuell.jumomind.com/mmapp/api.php to read MyMÃ¼ll waste schedule.
The usage is decribed [here](https://www.mariotti.de/abfallkalender-in-home-assistant-einrichten-mit-mymuell-als-datenquelle/). 

The adapter will request and analyze the return waste schedule and creates states for:
- the next waste collection with date and type
- the next waste collection with date for each type of waste
- optional a list of all dates provided

# Information for setup the instance
The configuration is set with Dummy Values for the City and waste collection Area for the API Call, so that no states will be set when intantiating the adapter. Follow the steps described in the instance configuration to determine your correct values and restart the adapter.

The Adapter is scheduled by default to run every 12 hours. As the Adapter is also calculating the remaining days for the next date, it should at leadst run once a day, otherwise it might be possible that the countdown is calculated correctly.
